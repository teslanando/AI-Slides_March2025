Artificial Intelligence (AI) is often surrounded by misconceptions, leading to both unrealistic expectations and undue fear. This presentation aims to demystify common myths about AI, such as the idea that AI will replace all jobs, the notion of machines achieving consciousness, and the belief that AI systems are infallible. By breaking down these misconceptions, we will highlight the true capabilities of AI, its current limitations, and the ethical challenges that need to be addressed. Attendees will gain a clearer understanding of what AI can and cannot do, helping to foster a more balanced perspective on the role of AI in our lives and industries. This session will also emphasize the importance of human oversight in the development and application of AI technologies.
